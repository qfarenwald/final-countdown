Imgs was created as a way to explore a new framework, Vue. Using the Unsplash API, a user can search for the top 10 photos that meet their search requirements.

### Focuses
- Professional workflow (git branches, commits, waffle board).
- Front-end engineering knowledge learned throughout time at Turing.
- The ability to use a concept/library/framework that you have not been taught explicitly at Turing.

### GIF
- This app is one page with a search bar at the top and all images display in a full page horizontally scrolling bar below. Simple. Easy. Beautiful.
